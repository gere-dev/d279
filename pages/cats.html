          Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
          region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the
          United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds,
          care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
          practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy
          family member regardless of breed.

        <p class="description">
          This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
          nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does
          their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats
          all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals
          rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the
          risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

        <h2 class="title">Seven Years and More</h2>
        <p class="description">
          Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
          experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats and
          calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing
          packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a particular
          protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish).
          This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser
          quality proteins.
